# Data Buff a.k.a [Let's Ask The Data](http://www.vijayn.com/projects/databuff)

This is an assortment of various data science / machine learning projects that I have worked on over the years. I used to host this initially on Bitbucket and Amazon S3, but am trying to consolidate all of it on GitHub.

The sections I intend to port over currently are:
1. **The Airline Report**, a monthly analysis of domestic airline data
2. **Random Walks**, various machine learning projects, primarily from [UCI's ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
